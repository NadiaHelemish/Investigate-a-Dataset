# Investigate-a-Dataset
<a id='intro'></a>
## Overview
To complete my Data Analysis project I am using NO Show Appointments dataset. This dataset contains information about 100K medical appointments on Brazil collected from The No-Show Appointments. Including: ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up

## Introduction
>This project is trying to find out the important factors behind by analysing the dataset which included the information of 100k medical appointments as well as characteristics about the patients in Brazil. The following questions will be explored in this report:
><li>(1) what is the overall appointment show-up vs. no show-up rate?</li>
><li>(2) Does gender has influence on the attendance of patients?</li>
><li>(3) Are patients more willing to go to the appointment that is scheduled in the near future?</li>
><li>(4) How activities done by an appointment scheduling office (sending SMS) influence show / no-show ratio?</li>
><li>(5) What's the difference between show-up rate for patient at different age?</li>
><li>(6) How is the health status for patients who did not show-up at medical appointments?
